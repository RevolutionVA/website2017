Your styles should be as high quality as all your other code. You should be able to easily make changes without introducing regressions, enabling your codebase to grow with ease. Automated testing and test-driven development facilitate this for front-end and back-end code, but why not also do it for your CSS?

This talk will introduce developers to Quixote, a Javascript library for automated CSS testing. It will show why and how to test CSS both at the unit and integration levels. Developers will learn how to apply Test Driven Development techniques to the process of implementing designs as well as how to introduce CSS testing to an existing code base.
